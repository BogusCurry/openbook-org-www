                        2.1 Better data sharing with applications
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        One of the great benefits of having a social media account these days is being able to use it to
                        log
                        into other applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is done through data sharing. The social network shares the information that the
                        application
                        <i>needs</i>
                        from you.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Example</h5>
                    <p>
                        This is what data sharing normally looks like.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's say you find yourself in a cafeteria. You notice there's an open WiFi network and you
                        connect
                        to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The box below appears on your screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>(Go ahead, click around as you would normally)</i>
                    </p>
                    <ob-generic-data-sharing></ob-generic-data-sharing>
                    <p>
                        Did you spot the problems?
                    </p>
                    <h5> Problem #1: What data did you actually share with the application?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Can you name the exact data that was shared with the application?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might say, <i>"well of course, it says clearly public profile, friend list, birthday, likes
                        and
                        email address"</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what is <i>"public profile"</i>? And did you click/hover the "<i
                        class="icon is-small fas fa-info-circle"></i>"
                        icon?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you do, you'll get some more information.
                    </p>
                    <p><i>"Your public profile includes name, profile picture, age, range, gender, language, country
                        <strong>and other public info</strong>."</i></p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from wondering why in the world would a WiFi hotspot need any of these, what qualifies as
                        <i>"other
                            public info"</i>?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>There is never a clear indication of the data being shared.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unacceptable.
                    </p>
                    <h5> Problem #2: Who determines what information the application requires from you?</h5>
                    <p>
                        You might be thinking, <i>"what a silly question, the application of course"</i>, they are
                        providing
                        a service, they know best.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And as it turns out, this is the current case in every social media. Companies register an
                        application, configure what
                        information the application "needs" from it's users, and they're done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a perfect world where all humans are honest and have nothing but good intentions, this would
                        work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In our world, companies more often than not, abuse this system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And with no supervision whatsoever of the system, they go ahead and request all the information
                        they
                        can about you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Be it to truly provide a service or to analyze and sell your data, we will never know. And
                        really,
                        it
                        shouldn't be our responsibility to find out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Social media companies should be responsible for ensuring applications do not abuse
                            their
                            data
                            sharing systems.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>All applications requesting access to user data should be examined in depth, by real people, with
                        the
                        privacy and security of their users in mind.</p>
                    <h5> Problem #3: What happens to your information once it leaves the social network?</h5>
                    <p>
                        So, you went ahead and hit <i>Continue</i>. What now?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where's the data?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What if you were to discover that these WiFi hotspots are owned by your local goverment which is
                        gathering this
                        information for mass-surveillance reasons?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Could you revoke the access to your data? But most importantly, could you make sure its deleted?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The answer is no. Once the data is shared, there's no going back. There are no procedures for
                        tracking it or deleting it.
                    </p>
                    <h5> Our solution</h5>
                    <p>
                        These are all clear and very serious problems that no social network as of today has been able
                        to
                        address.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps the privacy and security of their users, is not part of their priorities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They are part of ours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here's our prototype.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's say now you downloaded the awesome music app everyone has been recommending to you. As
                        soon as
                        you open the app, the box below shows up.

                        Sharing our information is sharing a bit of ourselves. That is why we want to make sure it's

                        <li>

                            Know at all times where your data is stored physically and have this information available

                            Have provable procedures in place to delete your information from ALL of their systems if
                            you
                            were to
                            revoke the permission.

                        For example, if an application does not require your friends list to provide a service but would
                        like to have it, this will be disabled by default.

                    <p>
                        If you want the application to have this information, you can allow this with the flick of a
