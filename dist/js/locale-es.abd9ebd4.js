For example rolling out updates (security updates/improvements included),\n                        maintaining cross-version compatibility (for example when rolling out a feature that is by design non-backwards compatible)\n                        and tracking, modifying or deleting user information across the nodes (pretty much impossible to guarantee).\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p>It is a mighty challenge by itself to develop a system that tackles all of these issues. It could take years of research and development.</p>\n\n                        <p>The software giants are growing at an incredible pace, crushing or buying any sign of competition.\n                            Initiatives for social media decentralization in all honesty and sadness, don't stand a chance.</p>\n\n                    <p>While they are focusing on building revolutionary technologies and ways to tackle the\n                        decentralisation system problems, the real users of such systems (people with a non-tech background) care little\n                        for that aspect of the product. They care about the experience, the features, the ease of use,\n                        the design. Once these initiatives solve the decentralisation challenges, they will be thousands of light years\n                        away from matching the features the software giants will then have. It would all have been for nothing.</p>\n\n                    <p>We are tackling the problem the other way around.
